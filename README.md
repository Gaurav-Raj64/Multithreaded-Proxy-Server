# Multithreaded-Proxy-Server

# Multithreaded Proxy Server using Java and Networking

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Multithreaded Proxy Server** built using Java and networking concepts. The proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and web servers, handling multiple requests concurrently using multithreading.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java
- Sockets (Java Networking API)
- Multithreading (Java Concurrency)
- HTTP Protocol

## 🌍 Features
- Handles multiple client requests simultaneously using threads.
- Forwards client requests to the target web server and relays the response.
- Caches responses to improve performance.
- Implements basic request filtering and logging.
- Supports HTTP and HTTPS connections.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. A client sends an HTTP request to the proxy server.
2. The proxy server checks if the response is available in the cache.
   - If cached, it returns the response directly.
   - If not cached, it forwards the request to the destination server.
3. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the proxy.
4. The proxy server relays the response to the client and optionally caches it.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaurav-Raj64/Multithreaded-Proxy-Server.git
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac ProxyServer.java
   ```
3. Run the Proxy Server:
   ```bash
   java ProxyServer <port-number>
   ```
4. Configure your browser or device to use the proxy server with the specified port.

## 🏗️ Implementation Details
- Uses **Java Sockets** for network communication.
- Implements **Thread Pooling** for efficient request handling.
- Includes **Logging Mechanism** for tracking requests and responses.
- Can be extended to support **SSL/TLS encryption**.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implementing advanced caching mechanisms.
- Adding authentication and access control.
- Supporting WebSockets for real-time applications.
